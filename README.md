Hello, I'm @EiwosOtma aka Otman, a self-taught Software Developper from France.

  I enjoy doing some JS, HTML, CSS and I also can work with C++, C# and PHP,
  I'm searching experiences mostly in these two languages.

  Sooner I'll put my blog in here, everything will be related to these technologies and Web part of the computer science field, where I'm specializing myself.
