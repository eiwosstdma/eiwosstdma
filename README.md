## About me

Hello everyone, I'm Otman, a self-taught software developper based in France, enthusiast about web technologies and programming related stuff.

I enjoy a lot of things, since the begenning of the 2021, I just felt in love with NodeJs and it's ecosystem. It's such a great piece of software and an enjoyable tool to use, so I decided to specialize myself into NodeJs and everything related about the EcmaScript ecosystem

Beside that, I really enjoy using C# and .NET and I'm trying to be proefficient with C++ because I would love to do some embedded stuff.

I enjoy plants, food, video games and above everything being with my Family.
