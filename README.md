## About me

Hello everyone, I'm Otman, a self-taught software developper based in France, enthusiast about web technologies and programming related stuff.

I enjoy a lot of things, since the begenning of the 2021, I just felt in love with NodeJs and its ecosystem. 
It's such an enjoyable tool to use, so I decided to specialize myself into NodeJs and everything related about the EcmaScript ecosystem.
I do use Angular.

Beside that, I'm also trying to be proefficient with C++ because I would love to do some embedded stuff.
